 This proverss follows the CI/ CD process of applying terraform for creating resources in GCP cloud

# ðŸš€ GCP Resource Deployment using GitHub Actions

This repository provides a simple example of how to automate GCP resource creation using GitHub Actions and Terraform.

## ðŸ”§ Project Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .github
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workflows
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ terraform.yml         # GitHub Actions workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ terraform
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf                # Terraform config file
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf           # Input variables
â””â”€â”€ README.md

To follow DevSecOps process, used "Github Secrets" for authentiation

To use the project, need to update the Github Secrets with your own credentials and create and update the main.tf file with a new GCP Storage bucket for storing remote state file of Terraform.
